COMP-465 Hair Rendering Project
Joseph Mena, Steven Mai. 

This project is built upon the boilerplate code of in-class activies and homeworks, namely the Geometry Shader Example in-class 
activity and the Cook-Torrance in-class activity. The turntable also comes from the Cook-Torrance in-class activity. We have coded
the following shaders: vertex, tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, and fragment. This is where the bulk of our
work is. The details on implementation is outlined in the final paper.

As far as we have tested, there should not be any performance issues whatsoever. As for bugs, we also have not ran into any.

This project does not require any specific method of building and running.

For results, there are many representations of hair strands of differing shapes that always follow the camera. The hair is rendered
to the left of the initial camera; there may not be anything on screen initially until the screen is moved using the mouse.
